A simple PC-IA32 bootable C runtime startup code based on memtest86 stuff.
You must have genisoimage installed and a 32/64 bit gcc for Intel architecture.
Type make and you will get a "standalone.iso" you can use to boot a VirtualBox machine.
It should work for a real target you can boot via PXE and i will test it soon.
In the main.c file you have a "_main()" function which is the entry point after startup code and basic hardware initialization.
Typicaly you can compile a MultitaskC file with a function you can call from "_main()" to get a native multitask application run.
Tested under linux with gcc version 4.4.5 (Debian 4.4.5-8), tried under cygwin but does not work for the moment.
