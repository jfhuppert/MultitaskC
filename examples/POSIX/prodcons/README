Type make and you will get two executables : dpc and spc. They are two version of a producer/consumer program communicating via a FIFO. dpc uses a dynamic implementation of the FIFO and spc a static one. It is just to let you see that classic OS communications between tasks can be simply implemented. The static version is the best because it uses rendezvous to implement the FIFO so it is completely compiled and the dynamic version uses "test and set" for FIFO implementation to illustrate the fact that every C expression is atomic in MultitaskC. Type "dpc 5" or "spc 8" to get 5 or 8 consumed values.
