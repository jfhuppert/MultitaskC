This is a copy of the TFTP client as available from
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/linux/system/Network/file-transfer; I
modified the code, so that it understands RFC1782 and RFC1783
extensions to the TFTP protocol.  This allows for negotating an
extended transfer block size of up to 1432 bytes (as oppossed to the
standard 512 bytes).  On busy networks, this will result in
considerably improved throughput and less load on the network.

For further information and for licensing conditions, please have a
look at the header of the source files.

I also added two command line options for changing the root directory
and for enabling debugging output.
