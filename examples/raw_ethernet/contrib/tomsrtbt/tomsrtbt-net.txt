Notes on turning tomsrtbt El Torito into a Etherboot image:

0. Tomsrtbt (http://www.toms.net/) is an all-purpose rescue and utility
1-floppy Linux system. You can read all about it at the web site. These
notes explain how to turn the El Torito version of it into a netbootable
image for Etherboot.  Note that the .img file is not an ISO image, it is
a 2.88M floppy emulation image for writing onto a CD-R(W) with mkisofs.
It's actually a minix filesystem.  Inside it are the kernel bz2bzImage
and initrd.bz2.

1. First uncompress the .img:

	bunzip2 tomsrtbt-2.0.103.ElTorito.288.img.bz2

2. Mount the image using loopback. You probably need to be root to do
this:

	mount -o ro,loop tomsrtbt-2.0.103.ElTorito.288.img /media/floppy

I've specified /media/floppy which is the floppy mount point for my
system, but any convenient directory will do.

3. Copy the kernel image and initrd off it:

	cp -p /media/floppy/bz2bzImage /media/floppy/initrd.bz2 .

4. Use mkelf-linux (or mknbi-linux) to make a netbootable image:

mkelf-linux --append='root=100' bz2bzImage initrd.bz2 > tomsrtbt.nb

root=100 means use /dev/ram0 (device 1,0) as the root device.

5. That's it. Clean up by unmounting the .img:

	umount /media/cdrom

tomsrtbt.nb can now be loaded with Etherboot. Have fun.
