This code was written by Dave Ashley for NXTV, Inc. It is released under
the terms of the GPL. The purpose is to let you write to the bootrom of
the SMC9462TX card. The assumption is that you've stuck an AT29C512 in the
socket. Note that the board has pins D5 + D6 reversed on the socket. Also
the socket only supplies 3.3V to the rom. Good luck trying to locate a
DIP programmable flash device that operates at 3.3V. What I do is to bend
pin 32 back and solder a wire directly from the 5V side of the 3.3V regulator
over to it. The dp83820's bootrom interface pins are all 5V logic tolerant.
However mod your board at your own risk, no warranty or guarantees are implied
or given!!! If you don't wire the 5V to the AT29C512, you can still read
the rom contents (it operates ok at 3.3V evidently) but you can't write to it
because the AT29C512 has a safety protection, it disables writes if the
power supply voltage drops below 3.8V.

See the comments at the top of the 2 C files for more information.

The Makefile needs to be hacked to build for your system. If you can't
figure it out you shouldn't be messing with this stuff anyway.
