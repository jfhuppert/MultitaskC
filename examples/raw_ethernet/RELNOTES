Etherboot 5.4.2

--

It is now possible to specify static boot information instead of
getting that information from a DHCP server.  This must be done
carefully, since there is no check for whether the address is unique,
and could potentially conflict with another network device. See the
options beginning with STATIC_ in src/Config for more information.

--

A new flag, EXIT_ON_FILE_LOAD_ERROR causes Etherboot to exit if boot
file loading fails.

--

PXE network booting is supported.  PXE is the most common network
booting method on x86-based machines, 

Using PXE requires configuring a dhcp server to provide a pxelinux.0 or
other PXE bootloader, 

For loading Linux, see the PXELINUX home page at:

For server setup, an interesting article is here:

You must specify an argument to make. Help text is now provided to
indicate possible make targets.

It should be possible to compile Etherboot with gcc >= 3.3.3, including
gcc 3.4.x now that a couple of bugs have been tracked down. Please mail
reports of success or failure to the etherboot-users list, together with
the versions of gcc and binutils used.

gcc 2.x is not supported anymore. You need at least gcc 3.x to compile
etherboot due to C99 constructs.

In order to create .iso and .liso images you need to have the packages
mtools-3.9.9 or later, and syslinux-2.08 or later installed.  These
packages are available in various locations and formats.  .liso images
are like .iso but use floppy emulation.  If you have a very old BIOS
and .liso images don't work you may wish to try adding the -s option
of syslinux as a last resort.
