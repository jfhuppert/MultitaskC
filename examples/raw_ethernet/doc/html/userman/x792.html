>&#13;Any computer that  is either physically  accessible or can remotely be
contacted over  a  network is  potentially  threatened by attempts  to
circumvent its security  measures.  The PC architecture is  especially
insecure and  using a BOOT-Prom can  help preventing some  of the more
obvious attacks. On the other hand,  it also enables some attacks that
are not possible against  machines that boot  from local  mass storage
devices (floppy,  harddisk, ...).  As  a general rule, you  can assume
that it is impossible to    protect your system from all   conceivable
attacks, but you can  try to minimize the  chance of an attack, try to
minimize  the seriousness  of the damage   caused and try   to help in
detecting   attacks  at  the  earliest   possible moment.   This  text
discusses some of the issues involved  and tries to raise awareness of
security problems; it cannot provide generic solutions to all of these
problems, but  should  help you in appreciating   the need  for proper
administration and regular security updates.
