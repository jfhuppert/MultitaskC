	User interaction options:

	-DASK_BOOT=n
			Ask "Boot from (N)etwork ... or (Q)uit? " 
			at startup, timeout after n seconds (0 = no timeout).
			If unset, boot immediately using the default.
	-DBOOT_FIRST
	-DBOOT_SECOND
	-DBOOT_THIRD
			On timeout or Return key from previous
			question, selects the order to try to boot from
			various devices.
			(alternatives: BOOT_NIC, BOOT_DISK,
			 BOOT_FLOPPY, BOOT_NOTHING)
			See etherboot.h for prompt and answer strings.
	-DBOOT_INDEX	The device to boot from 0 == any device.
			1 == The first nic found.
			2 == The second nic found
			...
			BOOT_INDEX only applies to the BOOT_FIRST.  BOOT_SECOND 
			and BOOT_THIRD search through all of the boot devices.
	-DBAR_PROGRESS
			Use rotating bar instead of sequential dots
			to indicate an IP packet transmitted.

	Boot order options:

	-DBOOT_CLASS_FIRST
	-DBOOT_CLASS_SECOND
	-DBOOT_CLASS_THIRD
			Select the priority of the boot classes
			Valid values are:
				BOOT_NIC
				BOOT_DISK
				BOOT_FLOPPY

	Boot autoconfiguration protocol options:

	-DNO_DHCP_SUPPORT
			Use BOOTP instead of DHCP.
	-DRARP_NOT_BOOTP
			Use RARP instead of BOOTP/DHCP.
	-DREQUIRE_VCI_ETHERBOOT
			Require an encapsulated Vendor Class Identifier
			of "Etherboot" in the DHCP reply
			Requires DHCP support.
	-DALLOW_ONLY_ENCAPSULATED
			Ignore Etherboot-specific options that are not within
			the Etherboot encapsulated options field.  This option
			should be enabled unless you have a legacy DHCP server
			configuration from the bad old days before the use of
			encapsulated Etherboot options.
	-DDEFAULT_BOOTFILE="default_bootfile_name"
			Define a default bootfile for the case where your DHCP
			server does not provide the information.  Example:
			  -DDEFAULT_BOOTFILE="tftp:///tftpboot/kernel"
			If you do not specify this option, then DHCP offers that
			do not specify bootfiles will be ignored.

	NIC tuning parameters:

	-DALLMULTI
			Turns on multicast reception in the NICs.

	Boot tuning parameters:

	-DCONGESTED
			Turns on packet retransmission.	 Use it on a
			congested network, where the normal operation
			can't boot the image.
	-DBACKOFF_LIMIT
			Sets the maximum RFC951 backoff exponent to n.
			Do not set this unreasonably low, because on networks
			with many machines they can saturate the link
			(the delay corresponding to the exponent is a random
			time in the range 0..3.5*2^n seconds).	Use 5 for a
			VERY small network (max. 2 minutes delay), 7 for a
			medium sized network (max. 7.5 minutes delay) or 10
			for a really huge network with many clients, frequent
			congestions (max. 1  hour delay).  On average the
			delay time will be half the maximum value.  If in
			doubt about the consequences, use a larger value.
			Also keep in mind that the number of retransmissions
			is not changed by this setting, so the default of 20
			may no longer be appropriate.  You might need to set
			MAX_ARP_RETRIES, MAX_BOOTP_RETRIES, MAX_TFTP_RETRIES
			and MAX_RPC_RETRIES to a larger value.
	-DTIMEOUT=n
			Use with care!! See above.
			Sets the base of RFC2131 sleep interval to n.
			This can be used with -DBACKOFF_LIMIT=0 to get a small
			and constant (predictable) retry interval for embedded
			devices. This is to achieve short boot delays if both
			the DHCP Server and the embedded device will be powered
			on the same time. Otherwise if the DHCP server is ready
			the client could sleep the next exponentially timeout,
			e.g. 70 seconds or more. This is not what you want.
			n should be a multiple of TICKS_PER_SEC (18).

	Boot device options:

	-DCAN_BOOT_DISK
			Can boot from floppy/hd if bootimage matches the
			pattern "/dev/fhsd*".
	-DTRY_FLOPPY_FIRST
			If &#62; 0, tries that many times to read the boot
			sector from a floppy drive before booting from
			ROM. If successful, does a local boot.
			It assumes the floppy is bootable.
			Requires -DCAN_BOOT_DISK.
	-DEMERGENCYDISKBOOT
			If no BOOTP server can be found, then boot from
			local disk. The accessibility of the TFTP server
			has no effect, though! So configure your BOOTP
			server properly. You should probably reduce
			MAX_BOOTP_RETRIES to a small number like 3.

	Boot image options:

	-DTAGGED_IMAGE
			Add tagged image kernel boot support (recommended).
	-DAOUT_IMAGE
			Add a.out kernel boot support (generic).
	-DELF_IMAGE
			Add generic ELF kernel boot support (recommended).
	-DEL64F_IMAGE
			Add generic ELF64 kernel boot support (useful for &#62; 4GB disks).
	-DWINCE_IMAGE
			Add the ability to boot WINCE.... now only sis630 OK!
	-DFREEBSD_PXEEMU
			Add the ability to boot PXE images... only FreeBSD supported
	-DX86_BOOTSECTOR_IMAGE
			Add the ability to boot 512 byte x86 boot sectors
	-DIMAGE_MULTIBOOT
			Add Multiboot image support (currently only
			for ELF images).
			Without this, generic ELF support is selected.
	-DIMAGE_FREEBSD
			Add FreeBSD image loading support (requires at least
			-DAOUT_IMAGE and/or -DELF_IMAGE).
	-DFREEBSD_KERNEL_ENV
			Pass in FreeBSD kernel environment
	-DAOUT_LYNX_KDI
			Add Lynx a.out KDI support
	-DMULTICAST_LEVEL1
			Support for sending multicast packets
	-DMULTICAST_LEVEL2
			Support for receiving multicast packets
	-DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_TFTP
			If defined, boots by TFTP (recommended).
	-DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_NFS
			If defined, boots from a NFS mount and disables
			TFTP loading. Default is DOWNLOAD_PROTO_TFTP
			if neither is defined.
	-DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_SLAM
			If defined, boots via Scalable Local Area Multicast.
	-DDOWNLOAD_PROTO_TFTM
			If defined, enables booting via TFTP Multicast mode.
	-DSAFEBOOTMODE
			Enables "Safe Boot Mode": Only boot images after verification
			with public-key-cryptography, this is WORK IN PROGRESS
			must be or'ed from one publickey storage method and
			one nbi-digest method value
			0  = store key in code (safeboot_key.h)
			1  = store key in ROM somewhere else (to do)
			0 = crypted digest in first 512 bytes -
			    as bytes 446...509 (compatible with most NBIs!?)
			16 = crypted digest as ELF block (to do... Eric?)
			So for now, only valid mode is "0" 

	Console options:

	-DCONSOLE_FIRMWARE
			Set for firmware/BIOS provided (default if nothing else is set).
			Normally this is shows up on your CRT.
	-DCONSOLE_SERIAL
			Set for serial console.
	-DCONSOLE_DUAL
			Both of the above
	-DCOMCONSOLE
			Set port, e.g. 0x3F8.
	-DCONSPEED
			Set speed, e.g. 57600.
	-DCOMPARM
			Set Line Control Register value for data bits, stop
			bits and parity. See a National Semiconditor 8250/
			16450/16550 data sheet for bit meanings.
			If undefined, defaults to 0x03 = 8N1.
	-DCOMPRESERVE
			Ignore COMSPEED and COMPARAM and instead preserve
			the com port parameters from the previous user
			of the com port.  Examples of previous user are a BIOS
			that implements console redirection, lilo and LinuxBIOS.
			This makes it trivial to keep the serial port
			speed setting in sync between multiple users.
			You set the speed in the first user and the
			rest follow along.

	Obscure options you probably don't need to touch:

	-DPOWERSAVE
			Halt the processor when waiting for keyboard input
			which saves power while waiting for user interaction.
			Good for compute clusters and VMware emulation.
			But may not work for all CPUs.
	-DRELOCATE
			After starting etherboot relocate to the top
			of memory.  This allows loading fairly arbitrary
			rom images.  This doesn't work with a couple of
			drivers, e.g. lance.

	BUS options:
	
	-DCONFIG_PCI
			Include support for devices using the pci bus.
	-DCONFIG_ISA
			Include support for devices using isa bus.
