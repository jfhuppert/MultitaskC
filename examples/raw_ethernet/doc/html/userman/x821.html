><P
>&#13;BOOTP  and TFTP offer almost   no security whatsoever. They  basically
provide their information  to anybody who asks and  solely rely on the
assumption that  your  network is configured to   not  make the server
world-accessible. If you install  BOOTP gateways, then this assumption
is  seriously violated. Also, TFTP server  are usually accessible from
just  about everywhere.  You  can try  to diminish  the  impact  of this
problem by blocking  BOOTP and  TFTP packets  from leaving or  entering
your network segment,  but this  will never   be  a completely  secure
solution.
</P
><P
>&#13;Thus you should always assume  that all of the  files that your  BOOTP
and TFTP server offer  are world readable. They  must not  contain any
sensitive data.    Also, the TFTP daemon  must   be configured to only
allow access to selected files.   Running it in a chroot'd environment
might be a very good idea.
</P
><P
>&#13;The BOOTP protocol is  vulnerable against somebody else  impersonating
as  a  BOOTP server. While   security aware operating systems, prevent
non-privileged  users  from starting their   own BOOTP servers, other
operating systems do not allow this. This means, if  any of your users
can launch an arbitrary program  under an insecure operating system on
an arbitrary  machine connected  to your  ethernet segment,  then they
have full control over the BOOTP boot process.
