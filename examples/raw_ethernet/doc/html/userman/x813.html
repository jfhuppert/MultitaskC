>&#13;There are a variety  of ways that   allow for booting Linux in  single
user mode.  The  most  common  techniques involve passing   a suitable
option  on  the kernel command line  (i.e.   "single") or crashing the
filesystem by  power cycling the machine; this  in turn will result in
fsck being invoked at the next system start, which will sometimes drop
you into single user mode.
</P
><P
>&#13;Some Linux distributions   do  not require  a password  when  entering
single user  mode.  While  this makes system   administration somewhat
easier, it  is a considerable security problem.  Make  sure, that your
system does not suffer from it.
</P
><P
>&#13;For other security problems with running insecure programs under Linux
or  using poorly configured    distributions,   refer to the    Usenet
newsgroups, security mailing lists  and  choose a distribution   whose
manufacturer frequently releases security fixes.   It is a fallacy  to
assume   that the unavailability of patches   implies the security and
correctness  of  a  software  application;   as a  rule  of  thumb,  a
manufacturer who releases more patches than  a different one, probably
cares more about  the security of  your  system than  the latter. This
also applies to operating systems other than Linux!
