When it jumps to the start location in the boot image, it must be in
8086 mode and be capable of going into any mode supported by the
underlying processor.

A0000h through FFFFFh, or between 98000h through 9FFFFh.

>&#13;The boot process must be capable of loading the image into all other
memory locations. Specifically, where the machine supports this, this means
memory over 100000h.

>&#13;The net boot process must execute the bootp protocol, followed by
the tftp protocol, as defined in the relevant rfc's.

record.
</P

>&#13;If less than 512 bytes are loaded, the net boot process attempts to
display on the screen any ascii data at the start of the image. The net
boot process then exits in the normal manner. For a boot prom, this
will allow normal disk booting. <SPAN

>&#13;When the first 512 bytes have been loaded, the boot process checks
for an initial magic number, which is defined later. If this number
is present, the net process continues loading under the control
of the image format. The image, which is described later, tells the
net boot process where to put this record and all subsequent data.
</P
><P
>&#13;If no initial magic number is present the net boot process checks for a
second magic number at offset 510. If the magic number 510 = 55h, 511 =
AAh, then the net process continues. If this second magic number is not
present, then the net boot process terminates the tftp protocol,
displays an error message and exits in the normal manner.
</P
><P
>&#13;If no initial magic number is present and the second one is, the net boot
process relocates the 512 bytes to location 7c00h. The net boot process
continues to load any further image data to 10000h up. This data can overwrite
the first 512 boot bytes. If the image reaches 98000h, then any further data is
continued to be loaded above 100000h. When all the data has been loaded, the
net boot process jumps to location 0:7c00.

>When the net boot program calls the image, it places 2
far pointers onto the stack, in standard intel order (e.g.
segment:offset representation).  The first far pointer which
immediately follows the return address on the stack, points to the
loaded boot image header. The second far pointer which is placed above
the first one, shows to the memory area where the net boot process
saved the bootp reply.
</P
><P
>&#13;If the boot image is flagged as being returnable to the boot process,
the boot program has to provide the boot image with interrupt vector
78h. It's an interface to services provided by the net boot program
(see below for further description).
</P
><P
>&#13;If the boot image is not flagged as being returnable to the boot
process, before the boot image is called, the boot program has to set
the system into a state in which it was before the net boot process has
started.<SPAN
