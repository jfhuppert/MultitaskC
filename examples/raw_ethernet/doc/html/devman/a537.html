>&#13;The compression code as implemented in "lzhuf.c" was taken from a BBS
program written by Joachim Schurig &#60;jschurig AT zedat PERIOD
fu-berlin PERIOD de&#62;. He states that the code can be used freely for
programs that are covered by a "freeware" license. This probably
includes both BSD style licenses and the GPL.

>&#13;The code in "zloader.asm" is a reimplementation of the uncompressor. It
has been written from scratch and is hereby placed under the
conditions of the GNU General Public License (GPL). The algorithm is
outlined in <A

>Appendix B</A

>&#13;Thus, there are no copyright problems with using this code, but there
still might be difficulties with software patents. These patents are
not legal in most parts of the world, but if you live in a country
that honors software patents then you should verify that using these
algorithms is legally permitted. Unless you are absolutely sure, that
there are no legal obstacles, you should use the code for educational
purposes only (this assumes that your educational institution is
exempted from patent laws). The author cannot be held responsible for
using the program code in violation of applicable local laws.

>&#13;If you are aware of patents that might affect the legality of using
the code in some parts of the world, please let me know.
