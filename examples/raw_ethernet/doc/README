This tarball should be extracted inside the top directory of an
Etherboot distribution and will create a subdirectory called doc.  This
is so that the references to the files src/NIC and src/Config will work
when rebuilding the documentation.

All these files, except a few in html for the website, are derived from
masters in the sgml directory. So please edit those.

The documentation is also online at http://www.etherboot.org/.  You
should consult that for the most up-to-date news.
