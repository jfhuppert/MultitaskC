Raw_ethernet stuff for MultitaskC based on etherboot package.
This is a work in progress and for the moment it is tested with VirtualBox.
Go to src and type "make bin/e1000.iso" so you will get a bootable image "e1000.iso".
Configure a simple VM with an e1000 adapter.
When you boot, you sould see broadcast packets with a "tcpdump" like program.
