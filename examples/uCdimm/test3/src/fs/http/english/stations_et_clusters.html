	<P>
	<B>MTX based workstations.</B>
	
	<P>
	We propose workstations based on the whole series of PowerPC ATX motherboards from Motorola : MTX.
	One possible configuration : 300 MHz PowerPC 604 MTX, 64 MB RAM (1GB max), 40M Hz 16 Bits SCSI,
	2 EIDE Ports, 10/100 MBits Ethernet, CIRRUS Logic 5446 Graphic adapter with 4MB VRAM,
	Keyboard/Mouse, Any SVGA Monitor.
	
	<P>
	<B>VMENET and CompactPCI clusters.</B>
	
	<P>
	We also propose clusters of VME or CompactPCI processor boards under PowerPlusLinux.
	The processors interconnection is made with the underlying bus directly.
	In the VME case, performances are 2.8 times a 100 MBits/sec Ethernet (270 vs 95 between a MVME2604 and a MVME2700).
	This is about 75% of the maximum possible bandwidth with Motorola's VME boards.
	All the standard UNIX network protocols are usable without any change in any program.
	
	<P>
	All the PowerPlus VME boards and crates are usable (9,12 and 20 slots). This is the
	same for the CompactPCI solution. Crates can be connected to each others with
	standard network links such as Myrinet.
	This highly integrated solution allows easier administration and support than a common workstation cluster.
	A software package that allow distributed programming is available and several others are currently ported.
	
	<P>
	<B>System setup and configuration.</B>
	
	<P>
	All our systems can be prepared and configured by us before delivery.
	We can also do on site installations and we propose online support via e-mail.
