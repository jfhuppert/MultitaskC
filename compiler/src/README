Just type make to compile it.
You need to have bison, flex, awk installed.
It works with 32 bit gcc.
If you have a 64 bit one you may have to add "-m32" flag for LDFLAGS and CFLAGS and install "gcc-multilib" package.
To install it copy ../bin/mtcc to a directory that is in your PATH before testing examples.
Then make clean.
