MultitaskC
==========

The MultitaskC programming language.
Taken from Hugo Delchini PhD thesis : http://hugo.delchini.free.fr/These/THESE_HDELCHINI.pdf

The "documentation" directory contains an overview and I will add a tutorial later.

Go to "compiler/src" and view README file.

Then you can try the examples in "POSIX" directory.
More examples for POSIX and real targets will come later.

The "misc" directory contains syntax coloring stuff for vim.

Sorry for all comments in french, I will translate them soon.
